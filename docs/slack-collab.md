## Collabarations using Slack

- Send notifications to everyone in the team with latest build status information.
- We can see which commit triggered that build and who was reponsible for pushing that code in to github.

- [This](https://circleci.com/blog/slack-integration/) blog has detailed instructions on how to integrate slack with CircleCI.
