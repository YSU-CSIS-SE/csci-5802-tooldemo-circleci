## Custom Configuration of CircleCI on a Large Open Source Project

- Find a large open source project that runs unit tests and requires some specific configuration.
- Fork the open source project to add a custom `circle.yml` to the project for configuration in CircleCI.
  - `circle.yml` will run commands needed to install libraries for build, etc.
 - Add the large open source project to CircleCI which will build the project and run tests.
 - Review results of tests.
